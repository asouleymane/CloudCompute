We talked a lot about our lives and interests and hobbies and then we ended up kissing on a playground and then we drove to a parking lot and listened to music as we made out a bunch of times. We held hands and cuddled and it was such a fun time and now we’re planning to go on a second date.

This equity share was part of my agreement for joining and I am about to be fully vested. The valuation on my shares is put at 50K, this is a private company and no plans to go public anytime soon. My question to others in this sub who are more experienced with tax strategy: how can I avoid paying an immediate capital gains tax (about 15-20%) when I receive these shares? I am not realizing any true income... just a transfer of equity ownership. Is there a tax shelter strategy using a Roth as I do not plan to liquidate anytime soon? Is there another method that one of you guys have used in a situation such as my own?  Please advise. Thanks in advance for the suggestions  /u/craphty r/personalfinance [link] [comments]\n",

      "Here's a story that's been rolling around my head for the last couple days. It's a bit rough and probably has a bajillion errors that I've somehow missed but I hope it's still enjoyable.   I awoke slowly with a great headache. The headache alternated between the back of my head and my temples. It was a pain that made me grit my teeth in agitation and frustration. My hearing was the next thing that began to return. Soon I was able to hear the howling of the wind instead of a tinny whistling sound. My vision was the next thing that recovered. My eyes had been open for longer than I had thought they were, I only realized that they were open as my vision slowly brightened and then focused on the grey sky that I stared up at. I slowly moved my limbs one by one. Good news was that they were all still there. Bad news was that they all hurt.  Ah! I remember! I had been thrown into the air….by an explosion!  I pushed myself up into a sitting position and, as I did so, I brushed away the thin layer of snow that had accumulated on top of me.  “Satchel charge,” I groaned, “That’s what he threw.”  How long had I laid unconscious? I glanced around the cratered frozen ground and my six eyes scrutinized the slashed open corpse that lay near me. In fact the frozen puddle of blood that had escaped the dead soldier’s innards had accumulated around my boots, leaving crimson colored ice on them. The soldier was a grey-furred hakkan like me. There was a gaping hole in the soldier’s gut, a hole that his intestines and other innards had slipped out from and into his lap. His waxy frozen face was stuck in a look of utter pain and despair. His frozen hands were pressed up against the gash in what had been a vain attempt to keep his insides inside.  I felt bile in my throat and turned away. It was only now that I began to feel a sharp pain on the left side of my face. I slowly probed that side of my face and felt that my fur was all matted. I inspected my hand, it was red with my blood. Snarling to myself, I reached for a roll of bandages that hung from my belt and began to crudely wrap a bandage around my head. It took several attempts as my frozen hands kept dropping the roll. When I was finally done, I had partly obscured my vision in two eyes but it was a worthwhile sacrifice to have made to staunch the bleeding.  I pulled myself up to my feet slowly.  ”How much time had passed? And...what even happened? My memory...it’s filled with fog….”   We had been quick marching down one of the old mining roads, a road that was sunken so far down that in some spots you had to stand up on the tip of your toes to see over the lip of the road. A patrol had been attacked on the edge of the settlement we had been deployed to. The relief forces that had been dispatched to assist the patrol hadn’t responded so it was up to us to act as reinforcements. We quick marched to the beat of distant weapons being discharged; we marched to the guttural sounds of automatic projectile weapons and to the barks of plasma rifles being discharged. We were on foot as our repulsorlift transports would need extra time to warm-up. Even our military, a military drilled to fight in a multitude of conditions including the frozen wastes of my homeworld still suffered the age old problem of machinery being unable to start in cold weather no matter what you did.  The falling snow pelted us and the cold infiltrated our armor and uniforms. Each and everyone of our breaths was mist that joined the low-hanging clouds around us. Our booted feet hammered the ground as we ran, disturbing the layers of ice that lay on top of frozen layers of mud. The weight of my pack seemingly increased as I ran. It moved more than it should be as it swung from side to side. Ah. I remember that I made a mental note to secure it later.   Let me do that now.  I fiddled with the straps on my pack and tightened it. I jogged in place and was satisfied that the pack no longer moved as freely as it had before.   The guttural chattering of projectile weapons was louder now; the spitting of plasmafire could only be barely heard through the clamors of battle.  The company’s comm channel crackled.  “Recon Team to Altan Company. Battle seems to be occurring fifty spans away from the road once it curves left near a forest. Estimated one minute countdown to our entrance to the battlefield.”  “Weapons check!,” hollowed the Captain, “Safeties off!”  In unison we checked the charge of our rifles and flipped the safeties to “off”. Those who carried a heavier variant of our rifles also inspected the barrels of their weapons. Those who wielded these squad support weapons had to be careful as the sheer amount of energy that was forced through their weapon’s barrels could result in catastrophic failure if the barrel became compromised. In my sixteen weeks on this frozen word, I’ve seen that happen exactly twice. For each of those times, the smell of charred flesh and fur was all that I could smell for the next few days.   I remember that as I ran I turned to Mora. Poor Mora! She is of a species that originated from a warmer world that rarely ever saw a single snowflake! And she lacked the fur that covered my species from head to toe. Consequently, she and her compatriots who also served in the Dominion’s military were bundled up considerable more than I was. Her suit’s heat was also turned up considerably more than mine was, a fact that would result in puddles of water forming at her feet if she stood for long periods of time on the snow covered ground. All soldiers need to be able to fight in a variety of environments, even in ones that were less than idle than what they would normally suited to. However, even with the extra weight she and those of her species were still able to keep up with the pace we marched at.  Mora….Mora! Where is she now? Mora? Mora?! Oh by the spirits!….oh no….I remember now! Mora? MORA?!  I stumbled through the snow, past the bodies and the frozen pools of blood they lay in. I staggered past the mangled corpse of the man who had led our company. I staggered past a legless torso and a body that had been normally torn in two by a mortar blast. I paused as I came across the corpse of a serican who had his gut ripped open by shrapnel. The ground around the body was saturated in the dead serican’s acid blood that ate away at the frozen ground.  I knelt by the corpse and removed it’s helmet. A face frozen in contortions of pain and fear stared back at me.  Whew. Not Mora.  I tossed the helmet to the side and closed the serican’s eyes.  I stood up and continued my staggering.  “Mora!,” I shouted, “Mora!”   “How’re you holding up?”, I had said.  “Been better,” she said through chattering teeth, “And you say that back home you played in this stuff all the time?”  I had chuckled.  “Always! We built forts out of snow and rolled balls of snow to make snow-hakkans. When we’re done here, you should come with back to Esponia for the winter feast. I swear, the weather back home is much, much better than this stuff.”  “Ha! Earlier I would have leapt at that offer but I might have seen enough of this frozen crap for a lifetime or six.”   I ran about frantically as I called her name.  “Mora! Mora! Where are you?! Morrrraaa!”  I ran from body to body. I looked for Mora and for anyone else who was alive in this frozen purgatory. Was it only I who had lived? Had everyone else already expired and gone away to be judged? Was I to wander until I died? Or what if I already died and--  “Mora! Anybody! A-anybody at all?! Can anyone hear me?”  I tripped over the legs of a body and plunged face-first into a snowdrift. I felt a sharp pain in my face as the shrapnel dug deeper and as the wound that the bandage had been wrapped around began to bleed further.  I could embrace of the snowdrift was oddly soothing as I laid there. My eyes....began to close. I could feel the snow accumulating on my back but I no longer cared. So tired…so very tired...   The sounds of battle came to a halt as we reached the bend in the road. All conversation came to a stop as we strained our ears. Only the howling of the mind and our own pounding hearts and feet were heard.  The Captain sounded unnerved when he spoke, “Recon! What do you see?”  “Bodies, sir. Everywhere.”  The Captain cleared his throat before asking the question that was on all of our minds.  “Ours or theirs?”, he asked.  “J-just ours,” said Recon with a twinge of panic, “Just...wait wait! There’s movement in the trees!”  “Take up firing positions!,” ordered the Captain.  We ran up to the sides of the embankment on the side of the road parallel to the forest. A team who operated a squad automatic weapon set up to my right. Mora ran further down the road away from where I took up position to join the other sericans in the company.  “See ya soon!,” she said with a wide grin.  “Yeah. See ya.”  As I peered down my scope at the forest, one of those who was in the recon team jumped down into the sunken road.  “Shorkan?”, I asked even though I knew the answer.  “Yup it’s me.”  Shorkan slapped a grenade attachment onto his rifle.  “Hey Shorkan?”  “Yeah Khutma?”  “I don’t see ‘em.”  Shorkan extended his rifle’s bipod and peered through its scope. He fiddled with the scope’s dial before he spoke.  “See those bushes towards the very edge of the forest?”  “Yeah I see them.”  “Look to the right about five spans and look about a span up.” “By the trees with needle-like leaves?”  “Yeah. See ‘em now?”  For a brief moment the thought that Shorkan was lying crossed my mind but then I watched the snow around the tree move. The biped dressed in white who had been crouching by the tree moved slightly to the left. Scrutinizing what I saw through my scope further, I was able to make out several more. I had trouble keeping them in sight though, with the wind picking up and snowflakes being hurled about, the figures would vanish into veil of falling snow. They appeared as indistinct shapes that flickered in and out of view.  “Were there any survivors from the patrol?”  “None that we found. Could be some closer to the trees or it could have been more of them that we saw.”  “Gotcha.”  For several minutes we stood there, eyeing the flickering shapes in the forest.  “Maybe they’ve had their fill?”, I wondered aloud.  “No, no,” said Shorkan “They would have left if they were done. They’re waiting for something.”  More time passed. A mortar began to be set up nearby. Steam began to rise up from below the mortar’s stand as the snow beneath it rapidly melted. The mortar team who handled the weapon wore special insulated gloves for protection against the heat. When fired, the mortar would launch a shell that would be coated in plasma as it was fired. It was a deadly fusion of older projectile weapons and modern energy-based weapons.  Even more time passed. My hands slowly began to go numb and I periodically rubbed them together. Shorkan stamped his feet as he waited. The fire-team to my right murmured to each other as they waited. They murmured about better times and about the future. The figures who stood around at the edge of the forest stayed put. Perhaps we would need to blast them out in order to engage them? In the past our mortars had successfully blasted away and set fire to the enemy’s cover thus forcing them to flee which resulted in an engagement with our forces.  The future…  “Rah!”, I scream-growled as I pushed myself up from the snowdrift. I slowly stood up on wobbly, frozen legs.  “At the very least I must go on...so they won’t be forgotten. And Mora...I’ll find her. I’ll find her!”   The wind howled. It howled so much that we didn’t know that their attack had begun until they were on top of us. For a brief moment there was enough pause in the wind for us to hear the sliding of their accursed skis against the frozen ground. They didn’t shout or taunt as they skid along the embankment behind us. They let the chattering of the guns that they unslung from their shoulders to do the talking. Shorkan died without a sound as his back was riddled with bullets. His body slumped against the dirt and ice in front of him rifle still in hand. I checked his vitals to be sure. The warmth was already well on its way out of his body as the frozen air took up residence within him.  “Behind us!”, yelled the Captain as he opened fire.  Soldiers in white flew along the side of the road with their skis. The information on the species who had colonized this world was scant. Their skis resembled some of my species own cold-weather modes of transportation, modes of transportation that were normally relegated to usage in sports or usage by those who lived in the northernmost latitudes. Perhaps the species on this world came from a similarly cold world, after all, that would explain why they colonized a planet that was currently going through an ice age.  We fired back at them with the reports of our rifles being drowned out by the chattering of theirs. Grenades were hurled down into the sunken road which sent geysers of newly liquified mud and ice shards up into the air with body parts and the screams of those who had lost a limb. A handful of their skiers went down. One was cut in the chest with his white uniform turning crimson as he died. Another had his head torn off as the fire-team to my right opened fire at close range.  As we dealt with the skiers, we temporarily forgot the soldiers in the forest.  Throwing grenades that released colored smoke as a last-second gift, the skiers melted away into the snowy landscape.  Then came the whistling. And then the crashing and screaming as the mortars began their song. They whistled until they reached a crescendo which was then followed by a crashing, brutal explosion. Mud and ice rained down from the sky with body parts.  “Return fire!,” scream-ordered the Captain to the mortar-teams.  Our mortar-teams countered with their very own barrage that lit up the foliage that the soldiers in white had taken shelter beneath. Snow and splintered branches rained down from the tree crowns onto the soldiers. If anything, our barrage seemed to make the enemy’s barrage to become even more furious as their mortars began to target our own mortars with frightening accuracy. Shards of burning metal went flying along with globs of plasma as their shells explored near our mortars.  Finally someone shouted it: “Medic!”  I slung my rifle around my shoulder and sprinted towards the call. I found the source of the call lying in the middle of the road. Two soldiers were next to him, one was kneeling while the other was firing at the retreating skiers. The soldier they stood around was missing a leg from the knee below. I slid my pack off and rummaged for what I needed.  “M-medic...g-guh….hurts….”  “Hey hey I’m here for you! Stay with me! What’s your name soldier?”  I began to tie a tourniquet. His suit had sealed off the wound and had begun to compress on the area above the amputation. Still he bled. I could see the blood bubbling out of the uniform beneath the armor plates.  “G-g-gah! I-I’m Karshon….oh! Agh!”  “Well Karshon….”  I stopped speaking as a shell landed nearby.  “Shit!,” said one of the two soldiers who stood by Karshon as debris began to pelt us.  Without thinking I moved myself above Karshon and winced as debris bounced off of the armor plates on my back.  “Well Karshon you should be alright…”  I fumbled for a syringe in my pack. Finding it, I held it up. Karshon eyed it with fear.  “For the pain,” I said as I gave him the injection, “I can’t do much else but we’ll get an evac soon.”  I hope  “I’ll come back and check up on you later. In the meantime…,” I gestured at one of his friends who was kneeling by him.  The friend had begun to unpack a blanket that he placed on Karshon.  “Watch him. If he starts to lose consciousness, yell for a medic. Either me or someone else will come by and do our best.”  “Yes sir. Thank you sir!”  As I jogged back to where I had been standing previously, someone else shouted for me. At first I couldn’t hear over the roaring din of the mortars.  “Medic!”  I snapped my head around and spotted a soldier who was staring at his ruined right hand while the soldier who held onto him shouted.  While I hurried over to them, a shell detonated right on top of them. As I thrown backwards, I got a glimpse of a widening mist of red that accompanied the geyser of mud and ice. My ears rung and my head hurt as I felt my heart hammering away as if I had just run a race.  It took me a few moments to clear the fog of disbelief and horror from my mind. I gasped and groaned and pulled myself up to my feet.  The cries for a medic had now increased exponentially. From all sides they came. I was torn in several directions as I ran up and down the road.  The mortars continued their orchestra of death that reached a new height of carnage as the skiers would strafe our positions as we attempted to recover. Bullets sprayed around me, hitting those to my left and to my right and yet somehow missing me completely. A patient died in my arms as his body was pumped full of bullets. I was sprayed with blood as those around me collapsed.  I tied bandages as quickly as I could. My hands trembled. Sweat dribbled down the part of my face that was uncovered.  “Retreat!,” ordered the Captain as he fired with his sidearm. His right arm hung limp at his side.  “Re-!,” he began.  A shell exploded near him and he was hurled into one of the road’s embankments. I barely heard the terrible cracking of his neck over the din of the mortar fire.  “You heard him!,” shouted the Lieutenant who was now in command, “Retreat!”  We were all panicked but we were orderly. While those who were still able laid down covering fire. The wounded were carried and dragged back the way we had came. The dead were left behind with the dying and the badly wounded. They screamed and they screamed for a medic. But we had to focus on those we could save. Like it or not, some would need to die. So we, the medics, ran around as angels of life and death. We chose who would have the best shot at living and did what we could to stop the bleeding and to get our comrades to carry them.  “Medic! Medic!”, the calls came from all sides.  “Medic!”, shouting a serican soldier as he did his best to hold down a kicking and screaming serican.  “IT HURTS!”, cried the wounded serican between tears, “Oh god…”  The soldier he was holding down...that scream...Mora!  “Mora!”  As I was running past the fire-team who I had stood by earlier, a grenade exploded near the team. Blood and entrails painted the road as the limbless dead and soon to be dead lay moaning and screamin. Shards of jagged metal went flying and dug into my armor and into my face. Blood began to trickle down the side of my face. I could feel its warmth as it stained my grey-white fur red.  One of the members of the fire-team looked as me in shock as blood flowed like a waterfall out of his chest. He stood for a moment, with a look of shock on his face.  ”Why me?” , he must have been thinking, ”I had so...much else to do…”  He collapsed with a gurgle. As he collapsed, I spotted the fire-team’s mangled weapon that lay at his feet.  “Shit.”  There was a brilliant flash and a thunderous roar as the weapon exploded. I was hurled up and out of the road and landed on my back. It felt as if a giant foot was pushing down on my chest as all of the air in my lungs was forced out in a whoosh! I would have laid there forever if someone hadn’t grabbed me by my pack and wrenched me up to my feet.  I was pulled back down in the road and joined the column of survivors. I stumbled and slid across the ground as the road was slick with mud and blood-stained slush.  Mora…  I spotted a handful of sericans in the retreating column. Bandaged and bloodied, they were doing their best to support the weights of their wounded who limped. Mora! I think I saw her! I began to push my way towards them.  “The mortars stopped!,” someone called out.  “Shit!,” cried out the Lieutenant.  “Incoming!,” shouted another, “Cavalry!”  From the forest they emerged, a line of white garbed soldiers who were mounted on slender beasts of burden. Some of the beasts were has white as the snow that they walked on while others were as brown as mud and a few were as black as night. As they stepped out of the forest, the mortars began once more. This time, the shells landed closer to the cavalry, forming a curtain of ice particles and dirt in front of them that they then advanced through.  They slowly rode forwards, closing the distance between the forest and the road as they advanced behind the curtain of debris. The soldiers who rode these beasts of burden were dressed in the same white uniforms as the ski troops and the same uniform that was worn by the soldiers I had seen in the forest. There was one minor difference though, nearly all of the mounted soldiers had forgone the metal helmet that the enemy soldiers normally wore and instead wore large fur hats. In the center of each hat was a skull and crossbones, a head of death that stared ahead with empty eye sockets. It was a symbol I had become well acquainted with as the unit I was part of had been on the receiving end of several ambushes in recent weeks. However, there never had been this many mounted soldiers before and they hadn’t attacked after a heavy bombardment. They had always struck fast, struck hard, and slipped away before any sizable losses could be dealt to their forces.  Once the mounted soldiers had advanced about a third of the distance, some of them unslung their short carbines from their shoulders and leveled them. There was also a sudden flash of glimmering polished metal as they drew swords. Swords! Normally it would be laughable to use swords outside of a ceremonial role. Yet when we had pushed them into a corner, they had found their olden weapons which they used alongside their already less-than-modern firearms. In the early weeks of war we had devastated their motorized units. An initial EMP pulse in their atmosphere had rendered most of their equipment useless while our plasma cannons then made short work of whatever vehicles they had left or had repaired. Once we began occupying land, we had confiscated most motorized vehicles after patrols had fallen victim to personal vehicles that had weapons mounted on truck-beds. Without vehicles, we had thought that their forces would finally be unable to mount any resistance. Instead of surrendering, they turned to beasts of burden and to vehicles powered by muscles. They struck hard and fast, using archaic tactics that somehow worked in this iced-over world. Sharpened to perfection out of an incredibly durable steel, their cavalry had time and again ambushed our soldiers with such a beastial ferocity. Their beasts would sometimes frighten our soldiers so much that some of the newer recruits would turn in flee! When not attacking during an ambush, these mounted troops would attack at the very end of a battle, when their targets would began to rout and flee.  Feeling fear growing inside me, I glanced around. It did look like we were on the very verge of being routed. Our losses were heavy and much of our heavier equipment had been destroyed. Even if all of our able-bodied soldiers fought, it would be impossible to hold them back for long.  One of the mounted soldiers screamed something. The cry, a single word, was then echoed by and down the line of graceful cavalry. It took a second for my helmet’s translator to kick in. I shuddered when I understood.  “Death! Death! DEATH!”, they shouted.  The cavalry charged. Wild war whoops and other cries were shouted up and down their line of thundering beasts.  “Urah! Oorah! Death!”  “Rearguard formation!,” ordered the Lieutenant hysterically, “F-form on me!”  A last ditch effort to save lives by spending lives. A thin, stretched out line of the more able-bodied soldiers began to form along the embankment facing the approaching cavalry. They would continue firing until they died, hopefully allowing everyone else to slip by.  The mortars fired for a final time, striking the ground in front of the rear-guard. They were deafened by the thunder of explosions and then pelted with debris as the veil of ice and dirt fell onto them. And then the mounted soldiers leapt through the descending veil of ice particles. They fell upon the stunned rear-guard, cutting them down with their sabres that flashed from side to side.  Then they fell upon the road, leaping down onto the road and charging into the mass of limping survivors. They charged, slashing and stabbing with their sabres and opening fire with their carbines. Everyone was fair game, the wounded were trampled, the able were sliced open, and those who raised their arms in surrender had their arms removed. Blood splashed onto the cavalry’s white uniforms, turning them from pale and graceful angels into vile, vengeful demon spawns. Their deaths heads grinned and leered at us as they chopped and eviscerated.  They did it so quickly! There was no time to think, no time to think rationally to do something in an attempt to hold them back. The road was the slaughterhouse and they were the butchers.  One of the butchers dropped a satchel behind him as he charged. There was a bang and I went flying, flying backwards up and out of the road. As I crashed back to the ground, my head snapped backwards and collided with something. Stars! I saw them, so many tiny little lights as my vision blurred before darkening. The sounds of the slaughterhouse around me quickly became vague and indistinct as I lost consciousness.  ”Mora….are you dead?”   I fell to my knees when I found the frozen pool of serican blood. The bodies of six sericans surrounded the frozen pool. Each of the six had been sliced open before being trampled by those mounted soldiers.  “Six….agh!”  I crawled to each body careful as I made sure not to touch the pool of blood. The blood pool was only partly frozen and it still sizzled as it chemically burned the ground. Serican blood was horribly acidic, a fluke of evolution that had evolved back when the serican forerunners were the prey instead of the predator on their homeworld. Non-sericans needed specially made gloves to handle the blood of a serican. To a serican, their blood was as harmless as water.  I rolled each corpse onto their back and removed their helmets. Two of the six were female but neither was Mora.  I sat in the snow confused.  “Then how?”  Suddenly I began to giggle.  “Seven! I remember now! There were seven sericans in the company!”  But wait, if I remember correctly, Mora was being carried by her serican brethren. Then where did she go?  I stood up and walked a circle around the bodies. At first I didn’t see it, but by my third circling of the bodies, I noticed a trail of blood. A trail of yellow serican blood that led away the corpses.  “So she did make it out alive!”  I couldn’t see any footprints as the snow had already obscured them, but there was the telltale track of acid blood that the snow had been unable to smother.  I adjusted my medic’s armband that I wore and set out after the thin trail of blood.   I walked for the rest of that evening. Night swiftly fell and the snow began to pick up. By the time I reached the end of the trail, I was hunched over the trail as I did my best to squint to stay with the trail. The trail terminated at a square, squat structure that seemed to be equal parts bunker and cabin. Normally I would have been more cautious, but as my limbs were quickly going numb, and since I spotted smoke being emitted from a chimney, I pushed the door open and entered the structure.  It was pure bliss when I stepped inside. I shut the door quickly as soon as I felt the warmth that was being emitted from a crackling flame that danced in the hearth. The warm, sparsely decorated room was heavenly compared to the frozen hell that was outside. As I glanced around, I nearly cried out with joy when I realized who lay in front of the hearth.  Mora! She was alive! She lay covered in a blanket in front of the hearth. The blanket rose and fell as she slept. Her uniform and her armor lay folded and hung from the hearth’s mantle. Her face was bandaged up and her right arm was in a sling across her chest.  ”Wait a second wait a second!” , I thought as my joy turned to confusion.  “There’s no way she would have been able to undress and bandage herself up with only one arm.”  ”Then how….?”  I heard footsteps and a door on the opposite side of the room opened. A human soldier holding two steaming bowls took a few steps into the room before he noticed me and froze in midstep.  The human said something and my translator whispered his words into my ears.  “Well...shit.”  With the little energy I had left, I leaped up from Mora and lunged at him while drawing my sidearm. I crashed into the soldier, knocking the ceramic bowls from his hand which then shattered and spilt some type of soup. I drove a fist into the soldier’s stomach which caused him to cry out as he stumbled backwards into the kitchen that he had emerged from. Slamming my larger frame into him again, I shoved him up against a wall of cabinets while bringing my sidearm up beneath his chin.  “Start talking. What were you planning to do to her?!”, I growled.  “Huh...ha….huh...I think as we’re both men of medicine we can both just calm down and talk this through…,” began the soldier.  Now that I had a chance to look the soldier up and down, I did notice that he wore an armband that I recognized as the human symbol for a medic.  “...and I really would like it if you decided to back away a bit or your friend is going to wake up to a bloodbath.”  As my rage evaporated, I finally noticed the knife that he held to the side of my neck.  “Ah.”  I stepped back from the human medic and holstered my sidearm. The human set the knife, a kitchen knife, down onto the counter behind him. He held onto his stomach with his other hand and winced. We both breathed heavily and rapidly as we stood face to face.  “You know,” said the human medic, “I wasn’t sure at all if you were going to notice that knife.”  The human’s face broke into a wild grin and giggled nervously to himself, “Heh. My whole life flashed past my eyes even!”  I smiled too and chuckled.  “You’ve got a translator, right?”  The human smiled again and tapped a device that was inserted into one of his ears,”Yup. Though I am going to sit down here since that blow to my stomach...boy does it ever hurt!”  The device didn’t resemble my translator or any other translator I had seen before. So it was safe to say that the human themselves developed their own translator.  “Sure. Sorry about that….”, I murmured.  The human sat down in a rickety wooden chair that stood next to an equally rickety looking table.  “No worries. It was understandable what you did.”  “So….what’s going on here? Why did you bring her here?”  I gestured out the door and towards Mora’s sleeping form.  “Ah right, her! Okay...so you know that battle from a few hours ago?”  “Yeah. I was in it.”  ”Though it was more like an outright slaughter. They drew us in by attacking the patrol and then proceeded to butcher us all.”  The human straightened up in the chair and a look of shock crossed his face, “Aw shit! I could have helped you too then! See, after the battle, I went out with other medics to look for any survivors - to look for anyone from either side. The other medics evacuated the injured from our side, from my side. I stayed around since I thought there had to be someone from your side who was still alive. And then I find her. It was getting late though so I headed to this building.”  The human paused to cough. He winced and held onto his stomach. I began to say something but then he snapped back at me, “Hey I’m fine! I would have done the same if I were in your place! I would have clobbered you good.”  He coughed again before continuing.  “There are buildings like these scattered around the land. They’re a shelter that can be used if you get lost or stuck outside at night. The surveyors and prospectors who charted this planet built them tough to stand firm against the elements and against the wildlife. I would have taken your friend with me back to where I’m based, but there's a storm moving in and I thought that the journey back home would probably kill her. Her arm is broken and she was suffering from hypothermia and bleeding heavily when I found her.”  “What would have happened with her if you had reached your base?”, an unintended amount of steel was injected my words.  “Prisoner of war. She’d be treated fairly. But with you here now I suppose she can go with you once the storm passes. And…”, the human sounded uncertain and paused.  “Go on,” I said.  “Aaaand maybe you’d let me go pretty please?”, he said with a smile.  “Least I can do,” I said as I returned the smile, “You saved my friend. I’m sure she’ll think the same anyway when she wakes up. And...I like to think that I would do the same thing that you did.”  “Ah. Whew...man you don’t know how worried I was just asking that,” laughed the human, “Oh and by the way, the name’s Nickolas.”  “I’m Khutma.”  “Nice ta meet ya Mr. Khutma”.  /u/Turul___Madar r/HFY [link] [comments]\n",
